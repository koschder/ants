These are all the versions of the AI I created for the Google AI Challenge
Fall 2011 contest Ants.  I kept seperate versions of the bot to test against
itself in a gaint tournament.  I was happy to end up in #93/7897 in the finals
and everyone put up an amazing fight. I look forward to the next contest.
